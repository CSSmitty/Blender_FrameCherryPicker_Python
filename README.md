# Blender Frame Cherry Picker

This is an addon for Blender which allows users to specify which frames they wish to render.

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Users are able to enter in specified frames which they would like to render inside the text box in the user interface. The different formates of input are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>frame, frame, frame</li>
  <li>frame-frame</li>
</ul>
<p>You may enter the frames to be rendered using any of the formats from above, or any combination of formats.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Download the addon from this git repository. From there open up Blender and go to User Preferences. There is an Add-ons tab in User Preferences, and along the bottom there is an option for "Install from file...". Select this option and navigate to the destination of this file and click ok. Next make sure that this addon is enabled, and then you will be able to begin using this addon.</p>

<h2>Issues and Contributions</h2>
<p>Please make any issues with the addon known by creating a issues ticket. These will be solved in a prompt matter as they come. Also feel free to make any suggestions for the addons through here. If you make a pull request for this addon and it fits the use of the addon I will add it in.</p>

<h2>Currently Working On</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Option to have naming of files be consecutive frame numbers, and not just the current frame being rendered</li>
</ul>

<h2>To Do</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Since UI for Blender freezes up while rendering, have a mouse icon to make users aware that this is working and not just hung up</li>
</ul>
